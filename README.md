# tripletotalcardgame
card game created by amista phillips

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Each player is dealt three cards face down.

On the count of three, players simultaneously turn over their cards.

Players add up the total value of their cards. Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points each, Aces are worth 1 point, and all other cards are worth their face value.

The game is played in three rounds.

At the end of each round, players can choose to keep their current score or discard one card and draw a new one from the deck.

The player with the highest total score after three rounds wins.

However, if a player gets a perfect total of 30, they win immediately.

On the other hand, if a player gets three Aces, they lose immediately.
